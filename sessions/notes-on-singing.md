# Notes On Singing

_For non-singers._

Singing has been a central part of Christian worship since the very beginning. Jesus and his disciples sang Psalms and hymns together, and the New Testament is filled with early Christian songs. Until the modern era, all major public liturgies and monastic recitations of the Divine Office were sung. And even today, the chanted Mass and Office remains normative.

Unfortunately, though, when small groups of Christians get together --- especially Catholics, and especially those in English-speaking countries --- we tend not to sing at all. Or we _might_ sing a few hymns or devotional songs we happen to know. But we don't usually **sing our prayers**.

But singing our prayers is exactly what our ancestors in the faith did. The great body of vocal music called _Gregorian chant_ is not a bunch of songs that can be added to the Church's liturgy --- it _is_ the Church's liturgy.

When we pray internally, silently, we engage the verbal part of the mind. When we pray out loud, especially with other people, we engage our voices and ears. When we sing we engage our whole being in prayer --- our breath, our posture, our heartbeat, our emotions.

St. Augustine said "_Cantare amantis est_. --- Singing is for lovers."

 > For the one who sings praise, does not only praise, but also praises joyfully; the one who sings praise, not only sings, but also loves Him whom he sings to... In the song of the lover, there is love.

How sad, then, that so many Christians in the modern world --- especially Catholics --- seem to have lost their voice. Much has been written about why Catholics can't sing, or don't sing, or won't sing. But let's set that aside and say: Catholics can sing. We do sing. We must sing.

And that means you. You personally. You can sing. You do sing. You must sing.

### You can sing.

If you can talk, you can sing. The mechanism of the voice is the same in both cases. You don't need any special training or expert knowledge --- children begin singing before they know any words to say. In cultures and religious traditions where singing is expected (which is most of them), everyone sings without exception.

And there is no such thing as being "Tone Deaf" (unless you are literally deaf). If you can listen to a song and recognize it, or enjoy a piece of music, you can _hear_ all of the tones in it. You are not tone deaf.

### You do sing.

Do you sing _Happy Birthday_ at parties? Do you sing the National Anthem at baseball games? Do you sing Amazing Grace at funerals? Do you sing along to the radio in the car? Do you sing in the shower? Do you sing lullabies to your children or grandchildren?

We all sing. It's just that some of us have gotten the idea that we shouldn't sing at certain times --- in front of other people, or when its important. (As in --- it's fine to sing in the shower because I'm just having fun, but I can't sing in church because that's supposed to be serious.)

### You must sing.

Singing is an essential part of what it means to be human. We all do, even people who claim to not be singers. Something so essential, so universal to human experience should become part of our daily interaction with the Divine. Too many of us --- out of fear or embarrassment --- withhold this important part of ourselves from our prayer life.



## Common Objections

### No one wants to hear me sing. My voice is terrible.

That is almost certainly not true.

Unless you have a serious (that is, diagnosable) vocal problem, there is no reason that your normal, untrained voice should sound bad when singing. In fact, the only people I have ever known two types of singers with unattractive singing voices:

 - people who were convinced they could sing well, and turned everything into a unbearable performance, and
 - people who were convinced they couldn't sing well, and tried much too hard to overcompensate.

If you simply sing with your normal voice, you normal voice will come through.

And besides --- singing your prayers isn't about performing for other people. You don't have to have an amazing, professional-quality voice. Remember that when you sing your prayers you are singing to God.

Think of it this way. Loving parents think that their children are beautiful, no matter what. And a loving spouse thinks that their partner is beautiful, no matter what. God is your Father, your Mother, your Lover, your Friend. God thinks that you are beautiful, and that includes your voice --- your singing voice.

### I'm always off pitch or off key.

This one might actually be true. But don't worry.

Pitch problems are universally caused by one of two things: insufficient breathing (the most common) or insufficient listening.

Insufficient breathing happens when we are too shy to sing, or too worried to sing, or are concerned about bothering people. So we take in timid little breaths and sing quietly so as not to annoy anyone. The result is that the sound we make is not very attractive and a bit under pitched. This confirms that we are "bad singers" and so the cycle continues.

The solution? _Just sing._

You don't need any special training or exercises. Just take in a nice, deep belly-breath and _sing out like you enjoy it_. In the vast majority of people, this solves the vast majority of problems.

As for the listening thing --- that's a little more difficult but it can be solved as well. Listening is something you do with your mind and your intentions, much more than it is something you do with your ears. The key to listening well is to first care about listening. You must care about the other people in the room, what they have to say, and what they sound like. You have to be genuinely interested in hearing them --- not just their words, but the meaning, the tone, the inflection.

This is why you can sing along with your favorite pop music on the stereo; you actually like the music and the person, and you care about what they are singing about. Additionally, when singing with the stereo, you _don't_ care about what you sound like. To sing well in a group, you have to bring that same level of interest and selfless other-focus to the singing. If you become as interested in those around you as you are with your favorite pop singer, you will be able to sing with them.

### Church music is... hard, boring, lame, silly...

Some of it is. Sure.

There are really great pieces of church music that are difficult to sing. They require professional training and rehearsal. There are really boring songs and hymns that have weaseled their way into the repertoire (who knows why?) that we might just be stuck with forever. There are (especially in the last half-century) lots of songs and hymns that just aren't very good, whether because of their uninspired lyrics or their trite melodies.

This program is not trying to address that problem directly. We are providing easy-to-sing chants that are fully integrated into the traditional prayer of the Church, grounded in the traditional music. Regardless of what kind of music you experience at your local parish, you can sing authentic liturgical music. The traditional music of the Church is not out of reach --- it is not too hard for you to incorporate into your personal prayer life.
