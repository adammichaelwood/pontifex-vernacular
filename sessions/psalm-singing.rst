There's a common joke about Psalm singing:

If two Anglican musicians agree about how to point the Psalms, one of them is lying to be polite.

Unfortunately, this tendency to dogmatism is not limited to Anglican musicians. Many people have very strong opinions about the *right* way to chant Psalms, and there are a lot of different ways of approaching it. ("A lot of different ways" is another way of saying: there is not one right way.)

In this course we're going to learn a way of chanting Psalms that:

- is based on the original :term:`Gregorian modes`
- is easily adaptable to any English translation
- does not require much preparation in :term:`pointing`
- does not require specially-printed copies of the Psalm with pointing
- provides room to grow from very simple melodies to the original Gregorian tones without having to learn a new system
- is fun

What is Pointing?
------------------

When singing the Psalms in the :term:`Daily Office`, we do not typically sing from a musical score that shows the entire text under notes on a staff. Instead, we sing from a :term:`Psalter` that only has the text, and we fit the melody of the :term:`Psalm tone` to it.

This isn't too hard because long stretches of text (several words, often) are sung to a single note (the :term:`reciting tone`), and typically the notes only change towards the :term:`cadence` --- the end of each line.

But this means that everyone singing together needs to know when to change notes. This is done by marking up the Psalm text with extra punctuation. That's *pointing*.

There are lots of pointing systems. Each one has its own benefits and disadvantages. Some are great for beginners because they are very easy to learn. Some are more complicated, but allow advanced groups of singers to do more interesting things. Some are suited to different types of melodies or different styles of singing the Psalms.

Clayton Psalm Pointing
-------------------------

The system we teach in this course was developed by David Clayton. and is well suited for beginners and amateurs, but still provides enough complexity that advanced chanters should not find it limiting.

Each line of a two-line Psalm verse is marked with an accent over the *last two stressed syllables*.

    O sing unto the |LORD'| with thanksgíving; *
    sing praises upon the harp untó our Gód:

The accents over the syllables correspond to accents over the notated Psalm tone.

.. Psalm Tone example.

White (or open) notes will typically be sung on more than one syllable. Black (or closed) notes are sung on a single syllable --- the syllable just before the accented syllable.

- You begin on the first white note, which is the reciting tone.
- If there is a black note before the first accent, you sing that on the syllable before the first accent.
- On the accented syllable, you sing the accented note.
- Stay on the accented note until the next accent causes you to change.
- If there is a black note before the second accented note, sing it on the syllable before the second accent.
- Sing the second accented note on the second accented syllable, stay on that note until the end of the line.
- Do the same thing for the second line.

Like most things, this sounds complicated to write out step by step, but it really is pretty simple and intuitive.

.. example

Consecutive Accents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the last two syllables are next to each other, and there is a black note before the second accented note, you'll need to sing two notes (a :term:`slur` in modern musical terms) on the first accented syllable.

.. example


Three Line Verses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Psalm verses are two lines long. However, some are three. Apply the Psalm tone formula to the second and third lines. Sing the first line entirely on the reciting tone. On the last syllable (stressed or not) of the first line, go down one scale degree. (This will be a whole or half step depending on what mode you are singing.)

In pointed Psalms, this is marked with a *dagger* symbol.

    He shall exalt the horn of his people: |dagger|
    all his sáints shall práise him; *
    even the children of Israel, even the péople that sérveth him.

.. music example


Pointing a Text Yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have a copy of Psalms you plan to sing with the pointing already printed, you can do it yourself. Just get out your pencil and lightly mark the *last two stressed accents* of each line.

If you are going to sing Psalms with a small group, you can talk through the text together beforehand while everyone marks their own copy. This makes it easy (you don't have to do any prep work before praying and singing together), and it gives everyone a minute to familiarize themselves with the text before singing it.

This is especially good in families and groups with school-aged children, as it helps them to learn how to think about the text on their own.

Most of the time, it will be obvious where the word-stresses fall in the text. But sometimes it isn't clear, or people simply disagree. It's fine to take a minute to think about different options. If there are kids, let them explain why they think it should be a certain way. Then, everyone needs to agree on a single way to do it. (If you are "leading" the group, it's usually a good idea to let other people have their way instead of you if it is at all reasonable.)

Doxology and Amen
------------------

Each complete Psalm should end with a :term:`doxology` and *Amen*. The doxology is four lines, or two verses. The psalm tone formula concludes before the *Amen*, and the *Amen* itself is sung on the :term:`final` of the mode.

    Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, *
    and to the Hóly Spírit:

    as it was in the beginning, is now and éver sháll be; *
    world withóut énd. | **Amen**.


Ison (Drone)
-------------

Whenever you sing Psalms with a group, adding an :term:`Ison` (or Drone) is a good idea. This is a single note, held under the singing of the text.

Adding an Ison under the singing improves the overall quality of the singing, making it easier to stay on pitch. It adds depth to the singing. It's also fun, and a good way to get everyone involved --- even people who don't think they can sing and young children who can't yet keep up with reading the words of the Psalms.

In the :doc:`Clayton Psalm Tones`, the ison is notated for each mode. In almost every case, the ison is the same as the :term:`final`.

Singing Antiphonally
----------------------

There is a long tradition of :term:`antiphonal singing` of the Psalms --- that is, singing back and forth between two groups. The first groups will sing a verse, then the second sings the next, then the first sings again, and so on.

If you have enough people (six is about right --- two groups of three with at least one strong singer in each group) this is a great way to add variety to the singing. The most traditional approach is simply left-side and right-side. You can also divide into men and women, adults and children, leader(s) and everyone else, or another grouping that makes sense for you.

You can combine antiphonal singing with the ison, and have the off-group (the one not singing) take up the drone. So as the text is passed back and forth to each side, so is the ison.

Antiphon
---------

Not to be confused with antiphonal singing.

In the Roman and Monastic forms of the office, each Psalm has an :term:`antiphon` --- a short verse which is sung before the Psalm and repeated again after the Doxology and Amen. Antiphons are usually :term:`proper` to the day.

If your daily prayer resource does not include antiphons, that's okay. Not all variations of the Daily Office include them. But if you have them, they are easy to sing.

The :doc:`Clayton Psalm Tones` include a separate :term:`tone` for the antiphon of each mode, but the melody is applied to the text the same way, with the same pointing system.

It is usually best to have a single person or small group sing the antiphon as a solo. Everyone else can participate in the antiphon by singing the ison.


Selecting Modes and Tones
----------------------------

There are nine Gregorian modes --- the numbered modes (1-8), and :term:`Tonus Peregrinus`. The :doc:`Clayton Psalm Tones` provide several melodic variations for each mode. Any variation of any mode can be sung to any Psalm as long as it is pointed as described above.

So, how do you pick a tone when you sit down to sing a Psalm or three?

When you are first starting out --- either by yourself or with a small group --- just pick one and stick to it. There's nothing wrong with singing every Psalm to Mode II over and over. Once you have mastered it, add another and alternate. Then, after a few days or weeks, the next.

.. totally subjective ranking of modes in order of easiest to hardest

Once you know all of them, you can mix and match as you see fit. Here are a few ideas for how to pick a mode when singing Psalm in the daily office...

- follow the mode laid out in the Latin chant books (see note)
- cycle through in order: 1-3; 4-6; 7-9; etc.
- select based on mood.

Try to think of the different modes and tone variations as options to add variety. Do them all if it helps your prayer life and makes it more fun to sing. If it feels too hard or burdensome to learn all the different modes, just stick to a few of them or even one. The important thing is singing the Psalms, not getting the modes exactly right.
